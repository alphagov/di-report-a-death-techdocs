# Technical Architecture

Report a Death is built using serverless technologies, as is standard in the Digital Identity programme.

The service is hosted on AWS in the EU-WEST-2 (London) region.

For accessibility reasons, pages are server-side rendered. This is done using typescript lambdas rendering nunjucks
templates.
Pages are rendered using nunjucks templates by typescript lambdas. Each page is rendered by a different lambda. These
are deployed using AWS SAM. DynamoDB is used for state.
