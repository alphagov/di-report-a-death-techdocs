# Technical Architecture

Report a Death is built using serverless technologies, as is standard in the Digital Identity programme. 

Pages are rendered using nunjucks templates by typescript lambdas. Each page is redered by a different lambda. These are deployed using AWS SAM. DynamoDB is used for state.
